# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). My goal is to participate in competitive programming contests and improve my skills in algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by problem topics:

- `Sorting and Searching`
- `Dynamic Programming`
- `Graph Algorithms`
- `Tree Algorithms`
- `Mathematics`
- `String Algorithms`
- `Geometry`
- `Others`

Each folder contains C++ solutions to the corresponding problems, along with comments and explanations of the approach used.

## Goals

- Solve all problems in the CSES Problem Set
- Practice regularly to improve problem-solving skills
- Compete in coding contests and challenge myself against the best

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the topic you are interested in.
2. Open the C++ file to view the solution and comments.
3. Use the explanations to understand the approach and learn new techniques.

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by solving additional problems or improving existing solutions.

Happy coding!
